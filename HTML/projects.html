                    <p class="gallery-content-detail">The calculator allows users to input numerical values, perform
                        basic arithmetic operations, and see the result on the display. It follows a simple design
                        to demonstrate the core concepts of building a calculator using web technologies. Keep in
                        mind that this is a basic example, and in a production environment, additional
                        considerations, such as input validation and security measures, should be taken into
                        account.</p>

                        choices and activities. By providing details about temperature, precipitation, and wind
                        conditions, weather forecasts help individuals plan their daily routines and make informed
                        decisions. Additionally, weather forecasts are crucial for industries such as agriculture,
                        transportation, and emergency services, allowing them to prepare for and respond to changing
                        weather patterns. Overall, access to accurate and timely weather information enhances
                        safety, facilitates planning, and contributes to the efficiency of various sectors.</p>

                    <p class="gallery-content-detail">A to-do list is a fundamental tool for efficient task
                        management. It provides a clear overview of pending responsibilities, helping individuals
                        prioritize and organize their daily or long-term goals. The act of checking off completed
                        tasks not only instills a sense of achievement but also serves as a motivating factor for
                        ongoing productivity. Ultimately, a to-do list contributes to reduced stress, improved time
                        management, and increased overall effectiveness in personal and professional endeavors.</p>
